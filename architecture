The Lambda Architecture is a layered approach that involves a batch layer, a
speed layer, and a serving layer. The batch layer stores and processes
historical data in batches, while the speed layer processes real-time data
streams in a distributed manner. The serving layer combines the outputs of the
batch and speed layers to provide queryable views of the data.

In contrast, the Kappa Architecture is a simplified version of the Lambda
Architecture that eliminates the need for the batch layer. Instead, it uses a
stream processing system to process real-time data and store it in a database.
This architecture is ideal for scenarios where real-time insights are critical
and historical data analysis is less important.


Lambda Architecture is good
